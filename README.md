# AVFoundationDemos

This is the companion app to Bob McCune's "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bobmccune/learning-avfoundation">Learning AV Foundation</a>" talk.  This talk was originally given at 360|iDev 2012 and was recently updated for a session at MN CocoaHeads.  

Here's a quick description of the demos:

### Playback ###
The Playback demo shows how to build a custom video player using AVAsset, AVPlayerItem, AVPlayer, and AVPlayerLayer.

## iOS and Device Support ##
This is an iPhone-only app and was designed and optimized for the iPhone 5.  I have made an effort to make this compatible with earlier models, but I have not tested on these actual devices.  If you encounter an issue on an older device please let me know.


## Credits ##
